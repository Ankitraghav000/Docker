  # What is Docker?
  Docker is a tool that keeps everything your app needs in one place.Docker provide platform as a service (PaaS) that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

  # What is Container?
  Container is like a box that provide a way of creating an isolated environment,in which applications and their dependencies can live.

  # Why we use Docker?
  We use Docker for several key reasons:
  ### Cost-saving: 
  Docker containers use far less memory, especially when compared to their counterparts (virtual machines). Thus, you spend less on IT infrastructure resources.
  
  ### Isolation:
  Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, which helps prevent conflicts between applications and improves security.
  
### Rapid Prototyping:
Docker allows developers to quickly create and test new features or applications without setting up complex environments.

### Easy Setup: 
Docker makes setting up applications straightforward. You donâ€™t need to manually install and configure software; everything the app needs is in the container.
