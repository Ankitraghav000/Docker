  # What is Docker?
  Docker is a tool that keeps everything your app needs in one place.Docker provide platform as a service (PaaS) that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

  # What is Container?
  Container is like a box that provide a way of creating an isolated environment,in which applications and their dependencies can live.

  # Why we use Docker?
  We use Docker for several key reasons:
  ### Cost-saving: 
  Docker containers use far less memory, especially when compared to their counterparts (virtual machines). Thus, you spend less on IT infrastructure resources.
  
  ### Isolation:
  Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, which helps prevent conflicts between applications and improves security.
  
### Rapid Prototyping:
Docker allows developers to quickly create and test new features or applications without setting up complex environments.

### Easy Setup: 
Docker makes setting up applications straightforward. You donâ€™t need to manually install and configure software; everything the app needs is in the container.

# Installation
### version
 Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
 #### How to check the version?
 ```
 lsb_release -a
```
### RAM 
At least 2 GB of RAM
#### How to check the RAM?
 ```
 free -h
```
#### Step 1. up-to-date system by using following command :
```
 sudo apt-get update
```
sometime curl package is not install in system, To install curl use this command: 
```
 sudo apt-get install curl
```
#### Step 2. Install the dependency packages required to install Docker.
```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```
#### Step 3.Install Docker
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```
Next, add the Docker APT repository to your system in the sources.list.d directory.
```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
update the local package index once more.
```
sudo apt update
```
Now, install Docker Community Edition 
```
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
```
Once installed, the Docker daemon or service should be running. To confirm this, run the command:
```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

#### To check docker is install or not
```
docker info
```
#### Check the version of Docker :

```
sudo docker --version
```
#### For help in docker
```
docker --help
```
# Container

#### To check the container
```
docker container ls
```
#### How to make a container
when we run command on terminal it will extract data from this website - https://hub.docker.com/
Here, ubuntu is OS name 
```
docker container run ubuntu
```
#### See all container
```
docker container ls -a
```
#### Run container in background only for 60 sec
```
docker container run -d ubuntu sleep 60
```
- -d Stands for :Detached mode
- Purpose: Runs the container in the background.
#### Make running container 
```
docker container run -d -it ubuntu
```
- -it Stands for: Interactive 
- Purpose: Allows you to interact with the container.

#### Stop the container 
```
docker container stop (container id)
```
#### Start the container
```
docker container start (container id)
```
#### Restart the container
```
docker container restart (container id)
```
#### delete a stopped container
```
docker container rm (container id)
```
#### Delete a running container
```
docker container rm (container id) -f
```
# Apache server 
Apache is a web server software that is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from visitors and sending them back the requested information in the form of web pages.

#### Make and come inside the container
```
docker container run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```
#### Exit from the container
```
ctrl+p , ctrl+q
```
#### Come inside the container
```
docker container attach (id)
```
or
```
docker exec -it (id) /bin/bash
```
#### Update the container
```ar2002/webimage
apt-get update
```
#### Install  apache
```
apt-get install apache2
```
Now come inside the folder
```
cd /var/www/html/
```
add welcome to keen&able
```
echo "welcome to keen&able" >index.html
```
#### Restart the service
```
service apache2 start
```
#### Check the ip add
```
docker container inspect (id)
```
ip add mention in 12th line from last

#### Check the output
```
curl (ip)
```
#### Check how much space container have used
```
docker container stats (id)
```
# Container port mapping
In Docker, port mapping is the process of making a specific port of a container accessible from the host machine or network. This allows services running inside the container to be accessed externally.
#### Create container with port no 
```
docker container run -it -p 3600:80 ubuntu /bin/bash
```
#### Install apache server 
```
apt-get install apache2
```
Now come inside the folder
```
cd /var/www/html/
```
add welcome to keen&able
```
echo "welcome to keen&able" >index.html
```
#### Restart the service
```
service apache2 start
```
#### Now check your system ip in another tab
```
ifconfig
```
#### Paste this on web browser
```
ip add :3600
```
## Change container name
```
docker container rename (id) (new name)
```
## Pause the container
```
docker container pause (id/name)
```
## Unpause the container
```
docker container unpause (id/name)
```
# Import the data from system 
```
docker container cp docker.svg (id):/[location(tmp)]
```
# Docker image
Docker images are used to create containers, which are instances of these images running in an isolated environment.


#### Export and import the container
```
docker container export ID>(file name)
```
#### Create image
```
docker image import (filename) imagename
```
#### Create container with image
```
docker container run -it imagename /bin/bash
```
#### Create image directly
In last two commands firstly we have to export the data in file then convert to docker image
Now, we can create image directly 
```
docker container commit (id) imagename
```
#### To check
```
docker image ls
```
# Docker hub
Docker Hub is a container registry built for developers and open source contributors to find, use, and share their container images.
![Docker-hub-registry(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b90ca6-9356-4fe0-a3b2-d4bbaf000bf8)


- visit https://hub.docker.com/
- create an account

## Pull images
- search image name in search bar
- copy the command
- paste the command in your terminal

  for instance, I want a mysql image  then I searched the my sql and copy
  ```
  docker pull mysql
  ``` 
## Push image
same name no image
### docker tag
```
docker tag imagename username/(any name)
```
### Login via cli into docker hub account
```
docker login
```
### Push the image
```
docker push (imagename)/{ar2002/webimage}
```
Now, In whole world your image can be acess by docker hub.

# Docker volume
A Docker volume is a storage, that is attached to conatiner and store all the data of container if in case container is stopped or crash than we can use this volume.
### Check volume
```
docker volume ls
```
### For help
```
docker volume --help
```
 ### Create volume
 ```
docker volume create (volume name)
```
### Check path
```
docker volume inspect myvol
```
### Copy path and paste in terminal 
```
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data
```
### Create some file
```
touch abc{1..10}
```

### Create container with attach volume
```
docker container run -it -v (vol name):/tmp --name (xyz) ubuntu /bin/bash
```
### Check volume data is available or not
```
cd /mnt/
```

# Docker swarm
Docker Swarm is a tool that allows you to manage workers by an individual manager.
Manager can manage container,image and volume at workers node.


Docker Swarm is made up of two main components:

- Manager Nodes / Master Nodes
- Worker Nodes

Docker swarm needs multiple OS to deploy the service, we can deploy it on any cloud like AWS but it is not open source that's  why basic info is mentaion here about docker swarm.
