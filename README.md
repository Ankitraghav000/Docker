  # Introduction to Docker
  Docker is a tool that keeps everything your app needs in one place. Docker provides a platform as a service (PaaS) that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in      container packages.

  # Introduction to Container
  A container is like a box that creates an isolated environment where applications and their dependencies can live.

  # Reason to Use of Docker
  We use Docker for the following key reasons:
  ### Cost-saving: 
  Docker containers use less memory, Thus, you spend less amount on IT infrastructure.
  
  ### Isolation:
  Docker containers and the host system are isolated from each other, which helps prevent conflicts between applications and improves security.
  
### Rapid Prototyping:
Docker allows developers to quickly create and test new features or applications without setting up complex environments.

### Easy Setup: 
Docker makes setting up applications straightforward. You donâ€™t need to install and configure software manually; everything the app needs is in the container.

# Installation
### version
 Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
 #### How to check the version?
 
 Paste this command in the terminal  to check the version.
 ```
 lsb_release -a
```
- lsb_release: Stands for "Linux Standard Base release." It is a command-line tool that provides information about the Linux distribution's release.
- -a: This option stands for "all." It instructs the command to display all available information.
### RAM 
At least we have 2 GB of RAM in our system to run docker.
#### How to check the RAM?

Paste this command in the terminal  to check the RAM.
 ```
 free -h
```
- free: This command displays the total amount of free and used physical memory (RAM) and swap memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the kernel.

- -h: This option stands for "human-readable." It modifies the output to be in a format that is easier to read, typically using units like KB, MB, or GB instead of displaying the memory in bytes.
#### Step 1. Up-to-date system by using the following command :

Paste this command in the terminal to update your system.
```
 sudo apt-get update
```
- sudo: This prefix stands for "superuser do." It allows you to run commands with elevated privileges (as an administrator) that may be required for certain operations, like updating the system.

- apt-get: APT: Stands for Advanced Package Tool, a command-line tool for handling packages. It allows you to install, update, and remove software packages.

- update: This subcommand tells apt-get to download the latest package lists from the repositories specified in your system's configuration files (typically found in /etc/apt/sources.list)
#### Step2: Sometimes the curl package is not installed in the system, To install curl use this command: 
```
 sudo apt-get install curl
```
curl: This is the name of the package you want to install. curl is a command-line tool used to transfer data from a server. It supports various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.
#### Step 3. Install the dependency packages to install Docker.

Paste this command into the terminal to install the dependency packages.
```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```
- sudo: Runs the command with superuser or administrator privileges.

- apt install: Installs the specified packages.

- apt-transport-https: Enables apt to retrieve packages over the HTTPS protocol, which is more secure than HTTP.

- ca-certificates: Installs digital certificates to ensure the system can verify the authenticity of HTTPS connections.

- curl: A command-line tool for transferring data using various protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.

- software-properties-common: Provides tools to manage software repositories, including adding new ones
#### Step 4. Install Docker

Paste this command in the terminal  to install docker.
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```
- curl -fsSL: This part of the command downloads the Docker GPG key from the specified URL.<br>
-f(fail): Stops the command if the server returns an error.<br>
-s(silent): Runs the command quietly without showing the progress bar.<br>
-S(show errors): Ensures errors are still shown even if -s is used.<br>
-L(follow redirects): Follows any redirects to download the file.<br>
- |: This is a pipe operator that passes the output of the curl command directly to the next command.

- sudo gpg --dearmor: This command converts the downloaded GPG key from ASCII (armored format) to binary format.
- gpg: Stands for GNU Privacy Guard, a tool for secure communication and data storage.
- --dearmor: Converts the key from its armored (text) format to a binary format.

- -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg: This specifies the output file where the binary GPG key will be stored.
- /usr/share/keyrings/: A directory commonly used to store keyrings for authentication.
- docker-archive-keyring.gpg**: The name of the file where the Docker GPG key is saved in binary format
  
Add the Docker APT repository to your system in the sources.list.d directory.
```
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
- deb: Specifies a Debian package repository.
- [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)]: Includes the system architecture (e.g., amd64).
- signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg: Uses Docker's GPG key for package verification.
- https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable: URL leads to the specific location where Docker's stable version for your particular Ubuntu version can be downloaded and installed.
- sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.List: This information is saved in a new file for the package manager to use.
-  /dev/null: no output or feedback from the command is displayed to the user.<br>

update the local package index once more.
```
sudo apt update
```
Now, install Docker Community Edition:
```
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
```
docker-ce: Specifies the package name for Docker Community Edition, which is the free, open-source version of Docker.<br>

-y: Automatically answers "yes" to any prompts that may appear during the installation process.<br>
Once you have installed the Docker daemon or service, it should be running. To confirm this, run the command:
```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

# Docker swarm
Docker Swarm is a tool that allows you to manage workers as an individual manager.
Managers can manage containers, images, and volume at the worker's node.


Docker Swarm is made up of two main components:

- Manager Nodes / Master Nodes.
- Worker Nodes.

![jdbsqluohzrw5ku5l096](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41d87518-8eea-4d17-8eb1-f2673a8e5e8a)

Docker swarm needs multiple OS to deploy the service, we can deploy it on any cloud like AWS but it is not open source that's  why basic info is mentioned here about docker swarm.

# Conclusion
Docker is a platform that make easy the process of building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environments.
